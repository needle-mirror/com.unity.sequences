    "changelog": "### Added\n* Sequence and Sequence Asset management features:\n  * New context menu action available from the empty area of the Sequences window to create a new Master Sequence.\n  * New context menu action in the Sequence Assets window to open and edit the Prefabs (base and variants).\n  * New context menu action in the Sequences window to instantiate an Editorial structure in the active Scene.\n  * Keyboard shortcut to duplicate a Sequence Asset Variant: control-D (Windows) / command-D (macOS).\n  * Ability to multi-select and bulk-delete sequences from the Sequences window.\n* Help icons with documentation links in the Sequences window, Sequence Assets window and Sequence Assembly window.\n* Possibility to use the regular Unity Editor features to manually fix invalid sequences if needed.\n\n### Changed\n* Update of the Unity Editor minimum supported version to 2022.1.\n* Users can now create Editorial structures with more than 3 levels.\n* Split of the Sequences window into two separate windows:\n  * The Sequences window is still the main entry point to use Sequences and focuses on managing editorial structures.\n  * The new Sequence Assets window replaces the Asset Collections panel and allows managing Sequence Assets and Variants.\n* Sequence recording functionality adjustments:\n  * A single Record option is now available in the Sequences window context menu to simplify the recording flow.\n  * The Record action of the Sequences window no longer automatically sets the output file path in the Recorder window.\n* Compliance with Unity standard namings and workflows:\n  * The default Sequences folder and file names no longer have spaces.\n  * Users can now rename Sequence Asset Variants on creation.\n  * Renaming a Sequence GameObject from the Hierarchy no longer renames the Sequence in the Sequences and Project windows.\n* UI consolidation and clean-up to streamline the user experience:\n  * Prevent users from editing an Editorial structure that is not loaded in the Hierarchy.\n  * Remove the Sequence/Master Sequence creation actions from the Hierarchy. The Sequences window is now the unique place to do it.\n  * Hide fields of the MasterSequence asset Inspector that don't currently have any effect.\n* Public API clean-up: remove unused/deprecated API elements.\n\n### Fixed\n* Prevent Unity from throwing an exception when deleting a Sequence after removing all clips from a Master Sequence's timeline."
