# Sequences window

Use the Sequences window to create, organize and browse through the [Editorial structure](concepts.md#editorial) of the Sequences youâ€™re working on.

To open the Sequences window, from the main menu of the Editor, select **Window > Sequencing > Sequences**.

The Sequences window mainly allows you to:

* [Set up the overall structure](#creating-sequences) of your cinematics.

* [Browse through all Sequences](#browsing-through-sequences) that compose your cinematics.

Additionally, from this window:

* You can manage the [activation of additional Scenes](#setting-up-scene-activation-in-a-sequence) in the context of specific Sequences.

* if you installed the Unity Recorder, you can quickly [record any Sequence](#recording-sequences) and export it, for example, to a video file.

### Creating Sequences

Depending on the Sequence level you are starting from:

* To create a Master Sequence, select the **+** (plus) button at the top left of the Sequences window, then select **Create Master Sequence**.

* To create a Sequence within another Sequence, right-click on the Sequence (or Master Sequence) that should contain the one you want to create, and select **Create Sequence**.
  >**Note:** If the parent Sequence is a Prefab, you might need to apply overrides from the Prefab instance to the Prefab asset to keep them synchronized. See [how to manage Sequences as Prefabs](sequences-as-prefabs.md).

When the new Sequence appears in the structure, you can directly rename it and press the Enter key or click anywhere to complete the creation.

Once you have created a new Sequence, you can use the [Sequence Assembly window](sequence-assembly-window.md) to populate it with Sequence Assets or Variants from your [Asset Collections](sequence-assets-window.md).

### Renaming Sequences

To rename a Sequence, select it twice, then type the new name and press the Enter key or click anywhere to confirm the renaming.

>**Note:**
>* The Sequences window currently prevents you from renaming a Sequence that is a Prefab (see the [suggested workaround](known-issues.md)).
>* If you rename a Sequence within a Sequence that is a Prefab, you might need to apply overrides from the Prefab instance to the Prefab asset to keep them synchronized. See [how to manage Sequences as Prefabs](sequences-as-prefabs.md).

### Deleting Sequences

To delete a Sequence from your project, select it and press the Delete key or right-click on it and select **Delete**. This also automatically deletes from your project all Sequences the deleted Sequence may contain.

>**Note:** If you want to delete a Sequence within a Sequence that is a Prefab, you might need to enter the Prefab Mode first. See [how to manage Sequences as Prefabs](sequences-as-prefabs.md).

### Browsing through Sequences

When you select a Sequence:

* The [Sequence Assembly window](sequence-assembly-window.md) displays the properties of the selected Sequence. This is where you can add Sequence Assets to the selected Sequence.

* The [Timeline window](timeline-window.md) displays the tracks contained in the selected Sequence. This is where you can trim and reorder the clips within the selected Sequence.

>**Note:** If you open a Sequence in Prefab Mode, you can only browse through the structure of this Sequence. See [how to manage Sequences as Prefabs](sequences-as-prefabs.md).

### Setting up Scene activation in a Sequence

To create a new Scene and have it activated during the time of a specific Sequence:

1. Right-click on the Sequence, and select Create Scene.
2. Select the location to store the Scene file and specify a name for it.

This action creates an empty Scene that you can further edit. It also creates a Scene Activation track in the selected Sequence in Timeline, and binds the new Scene to this track. Finally, it also additively loads the new Scene in the Hierarchy.

>**Note:** If you want to bind an existing Scene to the track instead of creating a new Scene, you need to create the Scene Activation track from the [Timeline window](timeline-window.md#scene-activation-track).

You can add Scene Activation tracks at any level of your Sequence structure, and you can use as many Scene activation tracks as you need in a single Sequence.

>**Important:** To see a Scene in your Scene and Game views when Unity activates it through a Scene Activation track, you must previously load it in addition to the Scene that contains your Sequences structure. Depending on your current task, you can:
>* [Load Scenes contextually](#loading-scenes-contextually) in Edit mode for any Sequence, directly from the Sequences window.
>* [Set up a Scene Loading Policy](#setting-up-a-scene-loading-policy) to automatically load Scenes in runtime.

### Loading Scenes contextually

If you have set up Scene Activation tracks in your Sequences structure, you can load any of the corresponding Scenes directly from the Sequences window, according to the context of the Sequence you are working on, in Edit mode.

To do this, right-click on the targeted Sequence and select one of the following actions:

| **Action** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Load Scenes** | Additively loads all the Scenes that are bound with a Scene Activation track at any level of the Sequences structure within the time range of the selected Sequence. |
| **Load specific Scene** | Allows you to additively load any specific Scene among the ones that are bound with a Scene Activation track at any level of the Sequences structure within the time range of the selected Sequence. |

### Setting up a Scene Loading Policy

If you have set up Scene Activation tracks in your Sequences structure, you might want Unity to automatically load the corresponding Scenes when you enter the Play mode or when you run a Player build of your project, to ensure that the result includes all of them whatever their current status in Edit mode.

To do this:
1. In the Sequences window, select the Master Sequence.
2. In the Inspector, in the **Sequence Filter** component, click on **Add Scene Loading Policy**.
3. Set up the [Scene Loading Policy](ref-components.md#scene-loading-policy) component according to your needs.

### Recording Sequences

You can use the Recorder to export the rendered video, an animation, or a specific render pass from a Sequence, directly from the Sequences window.

>**Note:** This feature is available only if you installed the [Unity Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@latest/index.html), and possibly other add-ons, depending on the type of data you need to export.

Right-click on the targeted Sequence and select one of the following actions in the contextual menu:

| **Action** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Record As...** | Opens the Recorder window and automatically sets the Start and End frames to the values that currently delimit the Sequence that you want to record.<br />Once the Recorder window opens, [add and configure Recorders](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@latest/index.html) according to the outputs you want to get, and manually start the recording. |
| **Record** | Opens the Recorder window and automatically starts the recording with the last used Recorder list and settings. |

>**Note:** The feature automatically adjusts the output path of the recording according to the Sequence you selected to record.
